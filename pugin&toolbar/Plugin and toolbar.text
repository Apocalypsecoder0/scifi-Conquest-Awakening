For a turn-based RTS MMORPG like your OGame-inspired game, the plugin and toolbar functionality will play a key role in enhancing user experience and providing players with easy access to critical game features. Here’s a summary of what the plugin and toolbar components could include:

	•	Icon Badges: Show badges for achievements, alliance status, or special equipment attached to the player’s empire or profile.

Additional Considerations:
	•	Cross-Platform Support: The toolbar should be designed for seamless integration across all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X) for cross-play functionality, ensuring users can navigate and manage their empires effortlessly.
	•	Localization: If the game is globally available, the toolbar and plugin text should be localized to cater to different languages.
	•	Customizable Layouts: Allow players to move and resize toolbar elements based on their preferences.
