### **2. Gameplay Mechanics**

#### **a. Game Loop**
The core gameplay revolves around building an intergalactic empire. Players start with a single planet and must gather resources, construct buildings, research technologies, and build fleets to expand their empire. Key goals include:
- **Expanding territory** by colonizing new planets.
- **Gathering resources** (metal, crystal, deuterium).
- **Building fleets** to engage in combat, defend against enemies, or explore the galaxy.
- **Engaging in diplomacy** with other players or forming alliances.
- **Attacking or defending** against other players in the same universe.

#### **b. Resource Management**
The three main resources are:
- **Metal**: Used for most structures and ships.
- **Crystal**: Essential for advanced technologies and ship components.
- **Deuterium**: Fuel for ships and advanced research.

Resource generation is time-based and tied to structures built on each planet (e.g., metal mines, crystal extractors). Players can upgrade these structures to increase production rates.

#### **c. Buildings and Structures**
Each planet has a set number of building slots, which players must manage carefully:
- **Metal Mine**: Increases metal production.
- **Crystal Mine**: Increases crystal production.
- **Deuterium Extractor**: Harvests deuterium fuel.
- **Research Lab**: Enables research of new technologies.
- **Shipyard**: Builds fleets and defense units.
- **Storage Facilities**: Expands storage capacity for resources.
- **Defensive Systems**: Protects the planet from enemy attacks.

#### **d. Research and Technologies**
Players can unlock new technologies by investing resources into research. The tech tree includes:
- **Energy Technology**: Increases energy production for planets.
- **Laser Technology**: Unlocks laser weapons for ships and defenses.
- **Shield Technology**: Improves planetary defenses and ship durability.
- **Hyperspace Technology**: Enhances fleet travel speed and capacity.
- **Espionage Technology**: Improves spy probes, enabling better intelligence on enemy fleets and planets.

#### **e. Fleet Management**
Fleets are essential for expansion, combat, and resource transportation. Players can build various types of ships:
- **Small Cargo Ships**: Fast but limited cargo capacity.
- **Large Cargo Ships**: Slower but can carry more resources.
- **Fighter Ships**: Basic combat units, effective in large numbers.
- **Battleships**: Powerful combat ships with high durability.
- **Destroyers**: High-damage ships specialized in fleet combat.
- **Espionage Probes**: Used for gathering intelligence on enemy fleets and defenses.

Fleets can be assigned to different missions:
- **Attack**: Engage enemy planets and fleets.
- **Defend**: Assist allies or defend your own planets.
- **Transport**: Move resources between planets or to allies.
- **Spy**: Gather intelligence on enemy defenses or fleets.

#### **f. Combat System**
Combat occurs in real-time but is resolved asynchronously. Players send fleets to attack, and the combat is calculated based on:
- Fleet strength (ship types, numbers).
- Technologies researched (weapons, shields, armor).
- Random chance to simulate variability in battles.

The result of each battle will be displayed in a detailed combat report.

#### **g. Diplomacy and Alliances**
Players can form alliances, which offer mutual defense, resource sharing, and joint attacks on enemies. Alliance members can communicate via in-game chat and coordinate actions. Players can also declare wars, negotiate peace treaties, or form non-aggression pacts (NAPs) with other alliances.

#### **h. Trading and Market System**
Players can trade resources using the in-game marketplace. Transactions can be direct or auction-based, where players post offers for specific resources in exchange for others. The market can charge a small tax or fee for transactions, and alliances may have their own internal trade systems.

#### **i. Events and Missions**
Occasionally, the game will offer special events or missions that provide players with bonus resources, temporary boosts, or unique ships. These events are designed to keep players engaged and provide additional goals beyond the core game loop.

### **3. User Interface (UI)**

#### **a. Main Screen Layout**
The main screen shows an overview of the player’s empire, including:
- Resource production rates and storage.
- Current fleets in action.
- Construction queues for buildings, ships, and research.
- Notifications for incoming attacks or alliance messages.

#### **b. Planetary Interface**
Each planet has its own screen, showing available structures, fleets, and defensive systems. Players can:
- Upgrade structures.
- Build ships.
- Manage resources and defenses.

#### **c. Fleet Management Screen**
A centralized screen for managing all fleets across planets. Players can assign missions, view fleet status (in transit, defending, attacking), and track travel times.

#### **d. Research and Technology Screen**
Displays the current research projects, available technologies, and the tech tree. Players can queue new research projects and see the time required for each.

#### **e. Alliance/Diplomacy Interface**
A separate interface for managing alliances, sending messages, proposing treaties, and coordinating attacks. It also tracks current wars, peace treaties, and diplomatic standings with other alliances.

#### **f. Combat Result Screen**
After a battle, players receive a detailed combat report showing:
- Ships lost on both sides.
- Damage dealt.
- Resources captured or destroyed.
- Any debris fields created (which can be salvaged for resources).
